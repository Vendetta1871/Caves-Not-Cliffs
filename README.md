__This__ mod based on 
_[other Caves and Cliffs mode](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/caves-and-cliffs)_,
all __new__ blocks in __my__ mode are taken from __there__.
Since __this__ mode __don't__ change cave's __shape__ generation, 
it's also highly recommended to try together with 
_[YUNG's Better Caves mode](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/yungs-better-caves)_ 
for better 1.17 experience.
